# Face Detection Model

Welcome to the Face Detection Model repository! This project encompasses the development of a face detection model using techniques in computer vision and machine learning.

## Overview

Face detection is a crucial task in various applications such as facial recognition systems, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. This repository hosts the codebase and resources related to my face detection model, which aims to accurately identify and localize human faces within images or video streams.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: This model leverages advanced deep learning architectures to achieve high accuracy in detection faces under various conditions including different lighting, orientations and occlusions.
- **Real-time Detection**: With optimized algorithms and model architectures, my face detection system is capable of real-time processing, making it suitable for applications requiring low-latency responses.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized into modular components, facilitating easy customization and integration into existing projects or systems.
- **Scalability**: The model architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for efficient deployment across different platforms and environments.
